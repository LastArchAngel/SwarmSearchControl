To - Do list
: Find how the rover moves - what functions are called, and what they actually do.
: Find out how the state machine works "fully".
: Find how the rotation speed is changed.
: Find out how to change the rotation speed only in the searchController. This is so that we don't slow down the rover completely.

Once we know how the rover is "controlled"(what functions are called), then we will be able to call the functions ourselves, and see how we can program the movement.

Turn - look, turn -look... we can try to implement a different search algorithm... so, don't randomly look in a direction.

Look at the GPS and how we can "cancel" the GPS.
