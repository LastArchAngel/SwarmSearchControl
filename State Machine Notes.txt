We have 5 states:
* Transform
* Rotate
* Skid_Steer
* Pickup
* Dropoff

Fall through:
	* Transform falls through to rotate.
	* Rotate falls through to Skid_Steer.
  This is done to make the code faster. Once the goal location is set, then rotate, once the heading is minimized, start moving to the goal location.

***** Transform *****
  This state is the "default" state. It initializes the movement and location. It is the initial state and moves on to the Rotate or Skid_Steer states.
  
******* Rotate ******
  This state is used when the current location and goal location  have a difference of .4 radians. It turns the rover but doesn't move forward. It will stay in this state until the angle is minimized. This is just the theta.

***** Skid_Steer ****
  

******* Pickup ******
  

****** Dropoff ******
  


The dropoff case is completely empty. We need to look at how to control the robot and how to efficiently and quickly return to the center.

The state machine initially checks its current location, it uses the map frame and odom frame.
