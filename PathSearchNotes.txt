One thing that I am not sure about is what we want to do.

Do we:

::Use all three robots to search for the blocks and then use memory to pick them up once all blocks have been located?

::Use a rudimentary search and return algorithm? (this one intuitively seems like the slowest)

::Have one robot searching and informing the others that more blocks exist?

::First research a little more and THEN try to come up with some more reasonable ideas.

::For now stick with what we know? That is just wasting resources AND time... I will look into the most basic part right now though. What it does when it finds a block :x

********* NOTES *********

Two functions:
	search
	continueInterruptedSearch
