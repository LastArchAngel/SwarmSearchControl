# SwarmSearchControl
My search controller algorithm code. This will have all of my changes for the ROS code. Meant to be a way for me to edit my code on my laptop and then test it in Linux.

This is where I will do all of my work.

To Do:

* I need to decipher what the code is doing, document WELL. They don't document AT ALL and I think they do it on purpose so that we need to learn what is going on.
* I need to start searching for machine learning and also for the search algorithms for robots. This is probably going to be the MOST difficult part of the project.
* I need to find SOME way to connect my laptop to the internet wirelessly on Ubuntu :/  NOTHING and I mean NOTHING is freaking working...
